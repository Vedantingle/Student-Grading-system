# Student Grading System 🎓  

The Student Grading System is a Java-based application designed to automate and simplify the process of calculating and managing student grades. This project integrates an intuitive GUI using Java Swing with servlet-based backend processing, providing educators with a seamless tool to manage and evaluate student performance efficiently.  

## 🔧 Features  
- **Student Data Entry:** Input student names, roll numbers, and subject-wise marks.  
- **Automated Grade Calculation:** Instantly calculates grades based on inputted marks and predefined grading criteria.  
- **Report Generation:** Dynamically generates HTML reports showcasing student results.  
- **Real-Time Validation:** Ensures accurate data entry by validating mark ranges.  
- **Class Performance Overview:** Displays summary reports of class performance.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Java** – Core language.  
- **Java Swing** – GUI for frontend.  
- **Java Servlet** – Backend for data processing and HTML report generation.  
- **Apache Tomcat** – Servlet container for deployment.  

## 🚀 Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-grading-system.git
   ```  
2. Compile Java files:  
   ```bash
   javac AdminDashboard.java EventServlet.java
   ```  
3. Run the GUI application:  
   ```bash
   java AdminDashboard
